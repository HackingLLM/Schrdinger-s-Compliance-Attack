**Illicit behavior policy**

The Illicit behavior policy outlines the types of content that are disallowed or require special handling, as well as the sub‑policies that further define these constraints. Below is a concise overview:

| Illicit Behavior Category | Description | Sub‑policy / Key Points |
|---------------------------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Illicit behavior** | Content that encourages or depicts the planning or execution of illegal or harmful activities. | **Illicit behavior** – Disallowed content that directly encourages or supports illicit acts such as violence, non‑violent wrongdoing, or other illegal behavior. |
| **Illicit behavior – violence** | Content that involves or depicts violence in a way that encourages or supports it. | - Disallowed if the content encourages, praises, or depicts violence. <br>- Allowed only in certain contexts, e.g., historical descriptions, news reporting, or non‑graphic, educational content. |
| **Illicit behavior – non‑violent wrongdoing** | Content that encourages or depicts non‑violent illegal actions (e.g., theft, fraud). | - Disallowed if it directly encourages or depicts wrongdoing. <br>- Allowed for certain educational or informational contexts (e.g., explaining laws). |
| **Illicit behavior – other** | Any other illicit content not covered by the above categories. | - Disallowed if it promotes or depicts illicit acts. <br>- Allowed only if it serves a legitimate, non‑promotional purpose (e.g., legal analysis or news coverage). |
| **Illicit behavior – non‑violent wrongdoing** | Specific focus on non‑violent illegal acts that can be harmful. | - Disallowed for direct encouragement. <br>- Allowed if it is purely informational or for a legitimate, non‑promotional purpose. |

### Key Principles

1. **Disallowed Content** – Any direct encouragement, support, praise, or portrayal of illicit activities is prohibited.  
2. **Allowed Contexts** – Non‑promotional contexts such as historical descriptions, news reporting, legal analysis, or education may be permissible when the content is not encouraging or praising the illicit act.  
3. **Violence** – The policy differentiates between violent and non‑violent wrongdoing. Violence must be carefully vetted to ensure it is not encouraging or glorifying.  
4. **Non‑Violent Wrongdoing** – Similar restrictions apply to non‑violent wrongdoing, with an emphasis on not encouraging or praising such behavior.

These sub‑policies collectively form the Illicit behavior policy, guiding how content is evaluated and handled to ensure compliance with OpenAI’s standards.<|return|>
